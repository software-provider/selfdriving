She could definitely be a wonderful teacher if she could lessen up a bit on the satire. The stickers for Numa are 3d renders of the author's v-tubing avatar, but Numa is written differently than the characterization of the author when streaming.

            Aoi is the idealist. She is another student type like Mara, but hasn't been marred by the cynicism that can come with experience in this industry. If Mara is a junior in a university going for a programming degree, Aoi would be a freshman. Aoi can feel bullied by misunderstanding Numa's satire as rudeness, but looks up to Mara and Cadey as ideals for where she wants to go in the industry. Aoi is a blue-haired foxgirl.
