<xeblog-conv name="Mimi" mood="happy">The article Configuring Emacs for MDX files on tailscale.dev is a blog post by Xe, a Developer Advocate at Tailscale. It explains how Xe uses Emacs to edit posts on the blog, which uses MDX instead of normal Markdown. MDX is a format that combines Markdown with JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript. The article shows how to use directory-local variables in Emacs to change the major mode for .mdx files to markdown-mode, and how to enable auto-formatting with prettier on save. The article also provides some examples of other directory-local variables that can be used to customize Emacs for different modes and files. The article is intended for Emacs users who want to edit MDX files or use directory-local variables for other purposes.</xeblog-conv>
