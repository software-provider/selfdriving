A lot of software these days is difficult to use with accessibility
tools. A lot of this problem is not really exposed to the people that
create the software. A lot of software seems to be made with the
assumption that people have working hands, they can use a mouse, and
that the text is legible. This is simply not the case for many people.

I would like to propose a challenge for people. Let's call it the
voice control challenge. For this challenge, you need to use voice
control on your mac, iPad, or iPhone and see how many of your
day-to-day tasks you can do without having to reach for a keyboard or
type on the phone manually.

Here are some important commands with voice control that will be useful:

* "Show numbers" – this command highlights every UI element that is
  interactable with a number. Saying the number will interact with
  that element. You can also use this to create commands like "drag 5
  to 6".
* "Show names" – this command will give names to every single UI
  element on the screen. You can use these names as arguments to
  commands like tap or click or drag. These names will also let you
  see inner details of how applications work.
* "Go to sleep" and "Wake up" – the first command disable voice
  control. This is useful for things like calls where you were going
  to say a lot of things that could possibly be interpreted as voice
  control commands. I also use this when I am talking with my husband.
  When I am done with the call or talking with my husband, I say "wake
  up". You can also use device classes as arguments to this command.
  For example, "go to sleep iPhone".
* "Press &lt;key&gt; key" – this will insert the key code for an
  arbitrary key. I use this a lot when using voice control for
  messaging apps. "Press enter key" is one of my most used commands.
* "New line" or "New paragraph" – this will create either a new line
  or a new paragraph in the document that you are editing. Note that
  this will not send messages in most applications.
* There are also a variety of text manipulation motions, and overall
  it feels a lot like Vim. It has the notion of paragraphs, so you can
  say things like "delete paragraph" and it will delete the entire
  paragraph of text. You can also say things like "go to end of
  sentence" or "go to end of line".

Many more commands are documented [on

You can enable voice control in the accessibility menus in the
settings app. I think it is well worth peoples time to learn how to
use this. This will give a new light into how accessible programs
really are, and hopefully it will give people the motivation to change
things for the better.

It is frustrating that people aren't going to figure out how difficult
it is to use a computer when you violate fundamental design
assumptions unless they do so. Also, make sure to stay hydrated. Holy
crap when you speak a lot more you end up drying out your throat a lot
more easily.

You win the challenge if you can do most of what you can normally do
without using an input device. You will also quickly find out that
electron apps are the bane of your existence. There is a reason that
most of my voice control is done with an iPad. It's not just because
I'm an apple fan.
