In May I created a draft of L'ewa, a draft for a conlang that I was
going to use personally/in my diary. This ended up not happening like
I would have liked, but I have actually found a good use for this
language. I want to use it to help build out a fantasy world for a
novel I want to write. As such, I'm going to treat L'ewa as a
protolanguage and then start evolving it into a more ornate and
detailed language.

One of the main things I want to write about in the novel is how
hierarchies corrupt meaning from the pure into a distilled form of its
former self. I would like to have L'ewa be a part of this. I built
L'ewa to be a more freeform magicky language, but I would like to try
and bake a few things into it:

* A formality system that inflects nouns into formalized forms (with
  some irregular forms to spice things up)
* Moving some things from an analytic system of particles to a case
  system that works on agglutination (like Esperanto or Russian)
* Make kirta (Creator) and other spirituality terms into swear words
* Maybe introduce a gendered grammar system
* Use a Latin-inspired script instead of the more witchy pictoral one

## Case Marking

Right now, sentence role marking is done with the ka, ke and ku
marking the subject, verb and object of the sentences. I'd like to
change it to something else like:

* -ka -> marks a nominative argument (all parts of the noun phrase get
  marked like this)
* -ku -> marks an accusative argument

I need to rejigger the pronoun system for this. I may also reintroduce
binary gender as a concept and make part of the core conflict of the
novel be related to the gender (or lack thereof) of the main character
Divae (name still WIP).

## Tense Marking

By default, every verb is seen as either past, present, future or
perfective with the actual meaning either specified explicitly or
inferred via context. Consider this sentence:

```
mi madsa spaloku
```

This could be "I ate an apple (in the past)", "I am eating an apple",
"I will eat an apple" or "I ate an apple", but which one it is would
be inferred from context.

The old tense markers are qu (past), qa (present), qo (future) and qe
(perfective). Perfective doesn't really make sense to me as a tense
anymore, so I'm going to drop it. This should end up with a system
like this:

* -qa -> present tense
* -qu -> past tense
* -qo -> future tense

So the following sentences would be something like "I am eating an
apple", "I ate an apple (in the past)" and "I will eat an apple":

* mi madsaqa spaloku
* mi madsaqu spaloku
* mi madsaqo spaloku

This is still all a work in progress, and I will probably change this
a lot to make it a bit less bad in the future. Right now this is a set
of ideas I've been thinking out, and I'm going to work at making this
better for the future. I need to do some reading up on languages with
case systems.
