[Note for the readers, I usually try to do one post per week. This is not that
post this week. I am just frustrated by being used as a human subject in a
Princeton study without my consent. If you are ever in a position to be doing
this kind of survey, please don't send legal threats around
recklessly.](conversation://Cadey/coffee)

This is a response to [CCPA Scam November
2021](https://blog.freeradical.zone/post/ccpa-scam-2021-12/) from the
[freeradical.zone](https://blog.freeradical.zone/) blog. On or about 2021-12-11
11:29 PM I got an email from [Maya Mishina](mailto:mayamishina@novatormail.ru)
with the following contents:

> To Whom It May Concern:

> My name is Maya Mishina, and I am a resident of Novosibirsk, Russia. I have a

This scared the shit out of me. My blog is a passion project that I do as a way
to get better at writing. I almost contacted a lawyer. This should probably have
stood out as suspect to me, however I am a believer that people have a right to
privacy and that they should be able to be forgotten. 

I go out of my way to ensure that this website handles as little user data as
possible. I have gone so far to do this that the only unique identifiers I deal
with are IP addresses, but even then only a tiny fraction of those IP addresses
even get to my server because I use Cloudflare for caching. I probably need to
set up some kind of proper log rotation in my server, but right now there are
only three things collected by my site:

1. If you are a patron to my site, your name shows up on [/patrons](/patrons).
   This queries the Patreon API to get the display name that you configured in
   your account and is refreshed every time the site restarts.
2. If you send me a [Webmention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webmention), they
   will be shown on the footer of the website. They are stored in a SQLite
   database on the same server. I can remove entries from that table upon
   request.
3. Your IP address is recorded in `/var/log/nginx/xesite.access.log` in common
   log format on my server which is located in the Netherlands. Here is an
   example of what this looks like:
   
```
127.0.0.1 - - [18/Dec/2021:04:04:57 +0000] "GET /security.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 2110 "-" "Go-http-client/2.0"
```

No other data is stored. Any intermediate things in the system journal disappear
after an hour or two because my journal is limited to 512 MB and my services are
chatty.

Here is what the application logged for that request:

```
Dec 18 04:04:57 lufta xesite-start[2121878]: 2021-12-18T04:04:57.585717Z  INFO xesite/2.3.0: - "GET /security.txt HTTP/1.1" 404 "-" "Go-http-client/2.0" 12.474Âµs
```

It is literally the bare minimum that I can get away with.

I probably should have consulted a lawyer before drafting this, but here is what
I replied with:

I should have expected this to be a human research study after the [University
of Minnesota
disaster](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22410164/linux-kernel-university-of-minnesota-banned-open-source).

Overall, I am disappointed in this. I want to have a positive outlook on
humanity. I want to be able to trust that requests to be forgotten are
legitimate. I am going to have a harder time doing that now.

In case you actually do want to make a GDPR/CCPA request, here is the process
and the rough steps I will take:

- I will need your Twitter username and any links listed on the Webmentions
  section of any article on my blog if you want those removed. I will require
  you to either tweet a magic phrase and email me a link to it, a DNS TXT
  record on the domain or for you to upload an arbitrary string to a path on
  your server. These processes will help me confirm that you are the person who
  wants the information. Send me an email to `privacy@xeserv.us`. If you want
  access logs deleted, please let me know what IP addresses to delete and I
  will see what I can do.
- I will prepare a `.zip` file that will contain the following:
   - The email conversation in the industry-standard `.eml` format.
   - Any SQLite rows from my Webmention service in `.csv` format.
   - Any request logs from nginx in `.log` format.
- This may take up to a week or two. I am only one person and I have a job.
  This blog is not my primary source of income.

I do not have to offer this service. I am not a business. I am a single person
that wants to get better at writing. Please do not include wording that gives me
the impression that you are making a legal threat. I know you are allowed to,
but it scares the shit out of me when you do that and will make me put your
request at the end of the list.

tl;dr: I got phished by trying to be a good netizen. Don't fall for [this
scam](https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/).
