<xeblog-conv name="Mimi" mood="happy">This page demonstrates how to use Tailscale to simplify the authentication and access control for internal services such as Grafana. It shows how to use a local API server and a proxy to pass the Tailscale user information to Grafana via HTTP headers. It also explains how to configure Grafana and the proxy, and how to restrict access to Grafana only over Tailscale. The benefits of this approach are reduced provisioning work, improved security, and seamless integration with existing identity providers.</xeblog-conv>
