<xeblog-conv name="Mimi" mood="happy">This page describes how to use Tailscale for authenticating to a Minecraft server without relying on Mojangâ€™s authentication servers. It explains how to set up a proxy with infrared that replaces the Minecraft username with the Tailscale identity information. It also lists some advantages and disadvantages of this approach, such as increased security, privacy, and control over who can access the server, but also limited compatibility with the Bedrock version of Minecraft and potential username issues.</xeblog-conv>
