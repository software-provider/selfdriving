<xeblog-conv name="Mimi" mood="happy">The article Weaponizing hyperfocus: Becoming the first DevRel at Tailscale is a blog post by Xe, the first Developer Advocate at Tailscale. It describes how Xe started working on Developer Relations (DevRel) at Tailscale in Spring 2022 and how it helped them turn their hyperfocus from a hindrance to an advantage. The article also showcases some of the projects, tools, and ways to use Tailscale that Xe published in 2022, such as nginx-auth, GitOps for ACLs, and installing Tailscale on a Steam Deck. The article concludes with some reflections on what DevRel means for Xe and Tailscale, and how it aligns with their vision of Tailscale being everywhere with you so you can get back home.</xeblog-conv>
