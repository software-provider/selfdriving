Security is impossible. We just like to pretend otherwise so that we can
constantly project this aura of impenetrability that will save us from having to
admit the reality that it's impossible. One of the biggest targets in the modern
information security world is [sudo](https://www.sudo.ws/). It is a command that
lets you *s*et *u*ser and then *do* a command. Sudo is one of the most widely
deployed programs on the Internet and is widely regarded as critical
infrastructure.

<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="grin">Sooo the creators and maintainers of sudo
take things very seriously by using something like
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), maintain a high quality standard of
malicious inputs by fuzzing all public attack surfaces, and try to minimize the
amount of code involved in order to prevent vulnerabilities from being a
problem?</xeblog-conv>

<div class="warning">A prior version of this conversation snippet was badly
phrased. You are reading an edited version in case this is relevant in internet
comment arguments.</div>

<xeblog-conv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">I don't know about the code quality
standards of the sudo project, but overall I don't see them doing any concerted
effort to try to migrate away from C (or to reduce the complexity of sudo) and
there are
[frequent](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22809) 
[security](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3156)
[vulnerabilities](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/sudoedit_selinux) that
result in attackers getting root access anyways. I really wish the industry as a
whole would take languages like Rust a bit more seriously and start actually
moving towards programs being safer to use because security vulnerabilities in
core infrastructure result in emergency patches. It was disappointing to see [an
attempt at using Rust in an important Python library torpedoed by users of
obscure architectures not supporting Rust](https://lwn.net/Articles/845535/).
Maybe the solution there is to use WebAssembly as a compile target instead of
making everything be native code. I wouldn't wish hppa's reverse stack growth on
anyone trying to write a compiler though.</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="sus">Oh god...</xeblog-conv>

I'm tired of this situation and I bet a lot of the ecosystem is too. There's
been talk and ideas, but not enough in the action department. I made a new tool.
A better tool. One that will let all of us proceed towards the future we
deserve. I made a sudo replacement named ðŸ¥º.

## <span style="font-size:xx-large">ðŸ¥º</span>

ðŸ¥º has no pronounceable name in English or any other speakable human language.
It is named ðŸ¥º, but it is referred to as `xn--ts9h` (the punycode form of ðŸ¥º) in
situations where emoji are not yet supported (such as Debian package names).

To use ðŸ¥º, install it (such as from the Debian package) and then run it in place
of sudo:

```
$ id
uid=1000(xe) gid=1000(xe) groups=1000(xe),102(docker)

$ ðŸ¥º id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),102(docker),1000(xe)
```

<xeblog-conv name="Mara" mood="hmm">Wait, what? That's it? How is this even
secure at all? If it doesn't ask you for your password how can you be sure that
an actual human is making the request and not some malicious
script?</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Numa" mood="delet">Using this program requires you to be able
to type an emoji. Most attack code is of such poor quality that they are unable
to run commands named with emoji. This makes the program secure.</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="coffee">This is not how any of this
works.</xeblog-conv>

Here it is broken down statement by statement.

First, I pull in a bunch of imports from the standard library and also the
[syslog](https://docs.rs/syslog/latest/syslog/) to write a message to syslog
about what's going on:

```rust
use std::{env, os::unix::process::CommandExt, process::Command};
use syslog::{unix, Facility::LOG_AUTH, Formatter3164};
```

Next, I create a main function that returns an
[`io::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html), this is an
error that is returned by most of the standard library functions that do I/O
operations with the OS.

```rust
fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
```

The correct usage of this program is to run it like `ðŸ¥º id`, so if the user
doesn't specify a program to run, then it should blow up with an error message
instead of panicking:

```rust
if env::args().len() == 1 {
    eprintln!("usage: {} <command> [args]", env::args().nth(0).unwrap());
    return Ok(());
}
```

<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="wut">Wait, what? Why is it returning that
everything is okay if the user is doing it wrong? Shouldn't it return some kind
of error code that the running program or shell can catch?</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Numa" mood="delet">It's a feature.</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="coffee">I really hope I never have to maintain any
of your code.</xeblog-conv>

Next, we grab the program name and arguments from the command line arguments of
ðŸ¥º and send a message to syslog that it's being run so that there is _some_
accountability after-the-fact:

```rust
let program = env::args().nth(1).unwrap();
let args = env::args().skip(2).collect::<Vec<String>>();
let mut writer = unix(Formatter3164 {
    facility: LOG_AUTH,
    hostname: None,
    process: "ðŸ¥º".into(),
    pid: 0,
})
.unwrap();
writer
    .err(format!("running {:?} {:?}", program, args))
    .unwrap();
```

<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="wut">Wait so the emoji works there, but it
probably isn't going to work in people's RSS feed readers? How does that make
any sense?</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Numa" mood="delet">It doesn't, lololol</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">UNIX is mostly devoid of the concept of
character sets. Any character is fine as long as it doesn't have a null
terminator (this ends the string in C). I'd be more amazed if the emoji use
broke something, as there are legitimate uses for putting non-Latin characters
into message buses like that. Also most RSS feed readers have very poor code
quality.</xeblog-conv>

Finally, the actual command is executed:

```rust
Err(Command::new(program).args(args).uid(0).gid(0).exec().into())
```

This works because I'm using the
[`CommandExt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html)
trait implementation of
[`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html) that adds
some methods we need:

- [`uid(&mut self, id:
  u32)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.uid)
  to set the user ID of the child process
  ([`setuid(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setuid.2.html) in C)
- [`gid(&mut self, id:
  u32)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.gid)
  to set the group ID of the child process
  ([`setgid(2)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setgid.2.html), though
  groups are starting to die out due to them not being across multiple machines
  without extra effort like configuration managment)
- [`exec(&mut
  self)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/process/trait.CommandExt.html#tymethod.exec)
  which runs the
  [`execvp(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html) system call
  that _replaces_ the current ðŸ¥º with the child process

The key part is the `exec` call at the end. One of the interesting things about
the `exec`-family of system calls in UNIX is that it _replaces_ the current
process if it succeeds. This means that the function will never return unless
some error happened, so the `exec` method _always_ returns an error. This will
make error handling happen properly and if things fail the process will exit
with a non-zero error code:

```
$ cargo run --release ls
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 0.06s
     Running `target/release/ðŸ¥º ls`
Error: Os { code: 1, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Operation not permitted" }
```

<xeblog-conv standalone name="Numa" mood="delet">Sure, this error message could
be better, but that's a 2.0 feature. This is a disruptive program poised to
totally reshape the security industry so we have to _move fast and break
things_!</xeblog-conv>

I'm fairly sure that this program has no bugs that aren't either a part of the
syslog crate or the Rust standard library.

## Installation

You can install ðŸ¥º by downloading the `.deb` file from [my
fileserver](https://pneuma.shark-harmonic.ts.net/.within/xn--ts9h/) and
installing it with `dpkg -i`. This will give you the `ðŸ¥º` command that you can
use in place of `sudo`.

<xeblog-conv standalone name="Numa" mood="delet">This will let you stick it to
the man and let you self-host your own sudo on a $5 a month VPS from a budget
host. You can't have any vulnerabilities if there are no bugs to begin
with!</xeblog-conv>

This is also known to work on Amazon Linux 2, so you can create blursed things
like this:

```
$ ssh -A xe@10.77.131.103
Warning: Permanently added '10.77.131.103' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Last login: Fri Jan 20 04:09:11 2023 from 10.77.131.1

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),10(wheel),1000(xe)
```

<xeblog-conv standalone name="Mara" mood="hacker">Pro tip! You can apparently
pass a URL to a `.rpm` file to `yum install` and it will just download and
install that `.rpm` file. This is incredibly cursed.</xeblog-conv>

The `.deb` package was built on Ubuntu 18.04 and the `.rpm` package was built on
Amazon Linux 2, so it should be compatible with enough distributions that you
don't have to care.

<xeblog-conv name="Mara" mood="hacker">There's even a manpage you can read with
`man 8 ðŸ¥º`!</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Numa" mood="delet">And most importantly, [patches
welcome](https://github.com/Xe/xn--ts9h)!</xeblog-conv>

<xeblog-conv name="Numa" mood="delet">By the way, there are many more lovely
ways to get root than just by asking nicely with `setuid`. Why doesn't this
program use those?</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Cadey" mood="coffee">We gotta save _something_ for part 2,
otherwise that would spoil all the _fun_.</xeblog-conv>
<xeblog-conv name="Aoi" mood="sus">I don't know if I like what you mean by "fun"
there...</xeblog-conv>
