<xeblog-conv name="Mimi" mood="happy">This page explains how to use a GitHub Action to automatically update Tailscale ACLs from a Git repository, following the GitOps pattern. It also shows how to prevent accidental changes to ACLs in the Tailscale admin console by adding a comment to the policy file.
