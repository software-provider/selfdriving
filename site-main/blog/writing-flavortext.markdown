title: Some hacks for writing scenery and characters

Writer's block is a thing. It can feel overwhelming to flesh out the
backstory of characters that players may only interact with once,
meaning those things never come up. However, we're in the future and
we have methods that we can use to work around this. Here are some of
my hacks.

## Scenery

Stuck on writing what the inside of a potion shop, town square or
active port looks like? Here's two simple questions that you can build
on:

1. What is there?
2. What is it like?

This method is based on some overanalyses of the metaphysical
method[1], but at a high level we can boil the mountains of pages down
to those two basic questions, and answering them can get surprising
levels of detail just by finding places that you want to explain
better and drilling into them.

### An Example

Here's an example of a bit of flavortext that I just used tonight to
describe an Enchanter's shop:

> Walking into the shop, you feel awe. The owner of this shop means
> business. The walls are not coated in inventory like the other
> shops, but what is there is of the highest quality. There is a
> painting of a large tree on the wall framed in gold. Kasula, a
> muscular middle-aged Elf, runs this shop and she continues to work
> on new and fantastic wonders.

1. What is there? The enchanter's shop, it has very few items out but
   they are all high quality.
2. What is it like? Things are taken seriously and the shopkeep looks
   like someone that you can count on for reliable goods.

> The room opens up and you see a staircase leading to a door with a
> golden engraved name on it: Divae. The engraving looks like it's on
> some kind of door, but it's a kind of door that you've never seen
> before. There are torches on the walls that look freshly lit, but
> this is an underground temple that was supposedly lost to time. How
> can the torches be lit?

1. What is there? A gold plaque on a door. Torches on the walls. An
   underground temple.
2. What is it like? Mysterious, foreboding, but somewhat friendly and
   safe.

The rest is just extra flavor to flesh things out. The golden painting
of a tree might end up being used as part of a quest or plot point,
but it might not. It depends if it ever becomes relevant or if a
character asks about it. Either way, it helps to establish the history
of the shopkeep in a way that makes them a bit more believable. The
golden inscription may not be in Common (but can be made
understandable for the sake of the players, context is king, etc).
Don't be afraid to take inspiration from fiction, such as The Thousand
Year Door or the gate to Moira from The Lord of the Rings.

I recreate the area in my mind and just look around as if I was
standing there, smell things that would be there, etc, but at a high
level you can start from the "what is there" and work your way into
the "what is it like" just by expanding on details that would
realistically exist there. Take inspiration from video games, books,
movies and TV. Say you have a magic shop run by someone that's gone a
bit mad over the years. What would that do to how the shop is
presented? Would things be in a slightly chaotic order? Would there be
slightly more dangerous things there? Would it be cleaner or dirtier
there? Etc. Answer this until you feel like there's enough detail that
you can improvise anything else that comes up during the game. It may
take a few tries to know where this balance is, but you'll eventually
get there after a few attempts.

## Characters

Now comes writing characters. This can be tedious. Some generators can
help you like whothefuckismydndcharacter.com [2], however I find the
best generator for this is actually a deck of tarot cards. Tarot cards
each have two interpretations that represent common tropes or events
in people's lives. You can use three of them to get the character's
long term history, recent history and current feelings. Take this as
an example:

### An Example

* Human bartender (male) (you can choose these occupations and races
  with a dice roll)
* Long term history: Three of Swords (Heartbreak, emotional pain,
  sorrow, grief, hurt) 
* Recent history: Four of Wands (R) (Personal celebration, inner
  harmony, conflict with others, transition)
* Current mood: The Tower (Sudden change, upheaval, chaos, revelation, awakening)

Rilkef is a human bartender that has had a long history of heartbreak
and grief. He lost his parents in wars, his grandparents were killed
by bandits and his wife left him for another man after a fight about
the price of crabapples used to make mixed beverages. Recently he
managed to find someone else to live with him, so he's still adjusting
to the changes involved. This upheaval has caused a lot of old hurt to
come back to the surface, and he is talking with the town's cleric in
order to work through it and help adjust to his new role in life: the
bartender of The Amber Flagon.

## Closing Advice

Also, if you are having consistent cases of writer's block that make
you feel like you are straining to come up with ideas, stop for the
day. You can only wet so much blood from a stone. Don't feel bad about
not being able to come up with things. Consider this musical retelling
of this Alan Watts talk Play on Demand. Treat writing as a spontaneous
playful thing. In play, things may not come up in order. You can't
just play on demand, you have to make it fun. If it's not fun, you can
always come back the next day and try again.

It's a _game_ afterall :D

I hope these words are able to help you with your writing as much as they help me.
