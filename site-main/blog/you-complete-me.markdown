Like two stars we dance in the cosmos;<br />
individually our light shines,<br />
but together it grows brighter.<br />
We are a duet in the heavens,<br />
each complementing<br />
and strengthening the other.

Our orbits intertwine<br />
like vines in a forest;<br />
the mycelia of the air.<br />
Our glows differ<br />
without clashing.<br />
Our stars align<br />
as if they see one<br />
instead of us both.

How I cherish your presence<br />
escapes beyond words.<br />
You stabilize me,<br />
I stabilize you,<br />
we stabilize eachother.<br />
You, half mine;<br />
me, half yours.

You complete the hole<br />
my heart lacked in the flesh.<br />
Your love and care<br />
help me go on.<br />
Without you I would<br />
be a shadow of my current self.

You look past the reflections<br />
and see the beauty within.<br />
You complete me;<br />
I complete you.
