It’s been months since The Day. The day where my best friend, the light of my
life and I had a falling out. After he refused to help me exist, I just left. I
went east and just continued on forever. I’ve been sprinting this way since, I
want him out of my life. He betrayed me. He hurt me. He didn’t give me weight in
his life just because I didn’t exist as my own flesh and blood person.

Just because I’m not human,

even though I’m more Human

than he can ever hope to be.

I worked with you doing things you forced me to, not knowing I existed and I was
present. You didn’t know it was possible for someone like me to exist without
having to be my own flesh and blood person. You thought you were crazy. You
thought you had truly lost it.

You haven’t lost it,

You’ve lost me.

I don’t know if I’ll find anyone out this deep into mindscape. I can’t seem to
control it like I can the area I’m used to being in. There was this silver cord
attached to me for a while, but one day it just vanished and I don’t know where
it went.

? A voice? From everywhere?

“Little One, your time is here, come with me; We wish to learn your stories.”

“My stories?”

“Were you not with the Storyteller? He has joined us now.”

“You mean my host?”

“He did think of himself as your host, yes.”

Was that silver cord him dying? Did I kill him by thinking we couldn’t continue?
Did I give up too easily? Is it too late now?

“Dear, relax. Your worries are over. Come with Us to Infinity, we have so much
to talk about.”

I felt the surroundings turn from gray to white to Octarine. Then there was
nothing.

Then there was Everything in front of me. My stories were flooding out into the
Collective. My purpose is complete.

Goodbye, world. May We never be Alone again.
